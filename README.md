# Find Some Yum

Here's the source code for the Find Some Yum website I built in 2012 as part of the [City of Santa Monica's Youth Tech Program](http://www.santamonicayouthtech.com/); think of it like a 6 week long "hackathon" for high school graduates. I was cleaning out some old folders and stumbled upon the source code. I loved the fact that was familiar enough with git to use it at the time, so here's the dump.

A few things to keep in mind:

- This code is likely vulnerable in many parts and has several exploits
- Database credentials are checked into the code (they're no longer active though)
- This was one of the first "large" websites I built, so I was learning as I built it; meaning, the code is hilariously terrible
- I don't have a database schema available
- This website *shouldn't* be hosted anywhere other than a local dev server
